      <div class="about-intro">
        <p>I’m Cheryl Terry, a passionate and inspiring transformation coach dedicated to helping you to create your best life- The life you deserve!
</p>

        <p>From 1994 to 2024, my world was international education. But behind the scenes, I was practicing what I preached: Intentional Transformation. By applying the same cognitive tools I teach, I successfully semi-retired at 46 and fully retired at 51.</p>

        <p>I didn’t just stumble into my ‘Best Life’- I designed it.
</p>
      </div>

      <p>Now, I’m opening the doors to help you do the same. If you’re feeling stuck in a cycle of ‘just getting by’ or struggling to find your true purpose, together we’ll create a roadmap to move forward.
</p>
      <p>Let's start the journey to creating your best life together!</p>
