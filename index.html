          <h2>Transforming Your Dreams into Reality</h2>
          <p>I'm Cheryl Terry, a passionate and inspiring transformation coach dedicated to helping you create your best life — the life you deserve.</p>
          <p>My coaching practice is built upon a strong foundation of experience. I worked for 25 years in education, and for the past 7 years, I have been working as a professional coach supporting clients through real, meaningful change.</p>
          <p>I don't just teach transformation — I live it. I personally transformed my life at a pivotal time, successfully semi-retiring at the age of 46 and retiring at 52. That experience gave me practical, lived insight into goal-setting, mindset shifts and effective planning.</p>
          <p>Now, I want to empower others to transform their dreams into reality. Let's start the journey to creating your best life together.</p>
