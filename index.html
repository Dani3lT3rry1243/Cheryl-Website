        <h2>Transforming Your Dreams into Reality</h2>
        <p>I'm Cheryl Terry, a passionate and inspiring transformation coach dedicated to helping you to create your best life— the life you deserve!</p>
        <p>My coaching practice is built upon a strong foundation of experience. I worked for 25 years in education, and for the past 7 years, I have been working as a professional coach. I bring extensive experience in coaching conversations and am accredited as a Professional Transformation Coach and Life Coach, as well as being a trained Cognitive Coach.</p>
        <p>I don't just teach transformation— I live it. I personally transformed my life at a pivotal time, successfully semi-retiring at the age of 46 and retiring at 52 years of age. I am living proof of the power of intention, as I learned to set intentions and manifest my dreams.</p>
        <p>Now, I want to empower others to transform their dreams into reality. Let's start the journey to creating your best life together.</p>
