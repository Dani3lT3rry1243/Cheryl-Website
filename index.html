      <h2>Transforming Your Dreams into Reality</h2>

      <div class="about-intro">
        <p>I’m Cheryl Terry, a passionate and inspiring transformation coach dedicated to helping you to create your best life- The life you deserve!</p>

        <p>My coaching practice is built upon a strong foundation of experience. I worked for 25 years in education, and for the past 8 years, I have been working as a professional coach. I bring extensive experience in coaching conversations and am accredited as a Transformation Life Coach, Professional Life Coach and Master Life Coach, as well as being a trained Cognitive Coach.</p>

        <p>I don't just teach transformation- I live it. I personally transformed my life at a pivotal time, successfully semi-retiring at the age of 46 and retiring at 51 years of age. I am living proof of the power of intention, as I learned to set intentions and manifest my dreams.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Now, I want to empower others to transform their dreams into reality.</p>
      <p>Let's start the journey to creating your best life together!</p>

          “I had a valuable experience with Cheryl, whose broad, open-ended questions uncovered numerous possibilities and led to important realisations about my assumptions and beliefs. Her attentive listening and clarifying questions greatly enriched our discussions, while her prompts inspired me to envision future aspects I had not previously considered. I'm genuinely grateful for this transformative coaching journey that helped solidify my insights.”

          “My session with Cheryl really helped me to articulate my priorities and be mindful of my goals moving forward in my career and life in general as I am navigating a huge transition of relocating to a new continent.
          I really like that Cheryl didn't try to pretend that she was knowledgeable about my context or experience. She didn't need to be, everything was inside me, she just helped to draw it out and make it concrete.
          I would highly recommend coaching from Cheryl for anyone that is juggling a lot in life and wants to move forward to live their best life, both professionally and personally.”
